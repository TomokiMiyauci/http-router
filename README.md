## Router

`Router` is a router that can match HTTP request methods and HTTP request URL
paths.

Since the Web convention is to use HTTP method and URL path to identify
resources, this should satisfy most people's needs.

It registers a handler from the method corresponding to the HTTP request method,
and can also use the dynamic paths available in the
[URLPattern API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLPattern).

```ts
import { Router } from "https://deno.land/x/http_router@$VERSION/mod.ts";
import { serve } from "https://deno.land/std@$VERSION/http/mod.ts";
import logger from "https://deno.land/x/http_log@$VERSION/mod.ts";
import cors from "https://deno.land/x/http_cors@$VERSION/mod.ts";

const router = new Router();

router
  .use(logger())
  .use("/api/*", cors())
  .get(
    "/api/users",
    (request) =>
      Response.json([{ id: "0", name: "Alice" }, { id: "1", name: "Bob" }]),
  );

serve(router.handler);
```

## API

All APIs can be found in the
[deno doc](https://doc.deno.land/https/deno.land/x/http_router/mod.ts).
