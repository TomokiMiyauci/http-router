HTTP request router for standard `Request` and `Response`.

- Based on
  [URL pattern API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL_Pattern_API)
- Web standard API compliant
- Declarative interface
- Functional programing pattern matching style
- Automatically `HEAD` request handler
- Nested route pathname
- Tiny, lean

## Packages

The package supports multiple platforms.

- deno.land/x - `https://deno.land/x/http_router/mod.ts`
- npm - `@httpland/http-router`

## HTTP request url router

`URLRouter` provides routing between HTTP request URLs and handlers.

Request URL are matched with the `URLPatten API`.

```ts
import { URLRouter } from "https://deno.land/x/http_router@$VERSION/mod.ts";
import { serve } from "https://deno.land/std@$VERSION/http/mod.ts";

const handler = URLRouter({
  "/api/students/:name": (request, context) => {
    const greeting = `Hello! ${context.params.name!}`;
    return new Response(greeting);
  },
  "/api/status": () => new Response("OK"),
});

await serve(handler);
```

### URL Route handler context

The URL route handler receives the following context.

| Name    | Description                                                                                             |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| pattern | `URLPattern`<br>URL pattern.                                                                            |
| result  | `URLPatternResult`<br> Pattern matching result.                                                         |
| params  | `URLPatternResult["pathname"]["groups"]`<br>URL matched parameters. Alias for `result.pathname.groups`. |

### URL match pattern

URL patterns can be defined using the
[URL pattern API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL_Pattern_API).

- Literal strings which will be matched exactly.
- Wildcards (`/posts/*`) that match any character.
- Named groups (`/books/:id`) which extract a part of the matched URL.
- Non-capturing groups (`/books{/old}?`) which make parts of a pattern optional
  or be matched multiple times.
- RegExp groups (`/books/(\\d+)`) which make arbitrarily complex regex matches
  with a few limitations.

### Nested route pathname

`nest` is nested URL pathname convertor. It provides a hierarchy of routing
tables.

Hierarchical definitions are converted to flat definitions.

You can define a tree structure with a depth of 1. To nest more, combine it.

Example of a routing table matching the following URL:

- /
- /api/v1/users
- /api/v1/products
- /api/v2/users
- /api/v2/products

```ts
import {
  nest,
  URLRouter,
} from "https://deno.land/x/http_router@$VERSION/mod.ts";

const routeHandler = () => new Response();
const v2 = nest("v2", {
  users: routeHandler,
  products: routeHandler,
});
const api = nest("/api", {
  ...nest("v1", {
    users: routeHandler,
    products: routeHandler,
  }),
  ...v2,
});
const handler = URLRouter({ ...api, "/": routeHandler });
```

#### Joining path segment

Path segments are joined without overlapping slashes.

```ts
import { nest } from "https://deno.land/x/http_router@$VERSION/mod.ts";
import { assertEquals } from "https://deno.land/std@$VERSION/testing/asserts.ts";

const routeHandler = () => new Response();
assertEquals(
  nest("api/", {
    "/hello": routeHandler,
  }),
  {
    "api/hello": routeHandler,
  },
);
```

## HTTP request method router

`MethodRouter` provides routing between HTTP request methods and handlers.

```ts
import { MethodRouter } from "https://deno.land/x/http_router@$VERSION/mod.ts";
import { serve } from "https://deno.land/std@$VERSION/http/mod.ts";

const handler = MethodRouter({
  GET: () => new Response("From GET"),
  POST: async (request) => {
    const data = await request.json();
    return new Response("Received data!");
  },
});

await serve(handler);
```

## HEAD request handler

By default, if a `GET` request handler is defined, a `HEAD` request handler is
automatically added.

This feature is based on RFC 9110, 9.1

> All general-purpose servers MUST support the methods GET and HEAD.

```ts
import { MethodRouter } from "https://deno.land/x/http_router@$VERSION/mod.ts";
import { serve } from "https://deno.land/std@$VERSION/http/mod.ts";
import { assertEquals } from "https://deno.land/std@$VERSION/testing/asserts.ts";

const handler = MethodRouter({
  GET: () => {
    const body = `Hello! world`;
    return new Response(body, {
      headers: {
        "content-length": new Blob([body]).size.toString(),
      },
    });
  },
});
const request = new Request("http://localhost", { method: "HEAD" });
const response = await handler(request);

assertEquals(response.body, null);
assertEquals(response.headers.get("content-length"), "12");
```

This can be disabled by setting `withHead` to `false`.

```ts
import { MethodRouter } from "https://deno.land/x/http_router@$VERSION/mod.ts";

const handler = MethodRouter({}, { withHead: false });
```

## Error handling policy

The router is a closure. It is designed to create handlers via initialization.

During the initialization step, routes are examined, actively looking for errors
and throwing errors.

This ensures that the routes you define are semantically correct.

Here are the conditions under which errors are thrown:

- Duplicate pattern
- Empty routes

These are all semantic errors that cannot be eliminated by type checking alone.

On the other hand, the handler created is guaranteed **not to throw errors**.

If your defined handler throws an error internally, it will be supplemented and
safely return a `Response`.

Here is the default response on error.

```http
HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
```

### Detect error

`onError` is called when an error is thrown internally by the handler. You may
customize the error response.

```ts
import { URLRouter } from "https://deno.land/x/http_router@$VERSION/mod.ts";

const handler = URLRouter({
  "/": () => {
    throw Error("oops");
  },
}, {
  onError: (error) => {
    console.error(error);
    return new Response("Something wrong :(", {
      status: 500,
    });
  },
});
```

## Spec

In addition to user-defined responses, routers may return the following
responses:

| Status | Headers | Condition                                                   |
| ------ | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 404    |         | `URLRouter`<br>If not all url pattern match.                |
| 405    | `allow` | `MethodRouter`<br>If HTTP method handler is not defined.    |
| 500    |         | `URLRouter`, `MethodRouter`<br>If an internal error occurs. |

## API

All APIs can be found in the
[deno doc](https://doc.deno.land/https/deno.land/x/http_router/mod.ts).

## Performance

version 1.2 or later

Caches URL matching results internally. This speeds up the response time for
requests that have already been matched by `^20X`.

### Benchmark

Benchmark script with comparison to several popular routers is available.

```bash
deno task bench
```

Benchmark results can be found
[here](https://github.com/httpland/http-router/actions/runs/3043238906/jobs/4902286626#step:4:60).

## Recipes

http-router can be used with any module.
